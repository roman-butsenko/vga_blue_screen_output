# vga_blue_screen_output
Repository, that contains my code for creating VGA output

This is another episode in the series of me getting to know verilog better.

VGA, I think, is the most visually pleasing (if done right) output on the noard and it would be a shame not to pay some attention to it.

This repository, same as my previous one, consists of three types of files, required to create an FPGA design: verilog code, that describes the curcuit begaviour, constraints file that describes physical connections of nets in the design to the FPGA pins and testbench that allows to check the timing diagramms of any signal in the circuit before programming it to the board.

There are two design soources listed in the repository
